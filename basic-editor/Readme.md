# Basic JS/PHP editor for OSM
This "editor" is so basic and WIP that it doesn't even have backend.
Frontend is built on leaflet with few cues from iD, while backend will be one day built onto Level0 editor.

Greatest feature so far is integration with Editor-Layer-Index to support imagery worldwide.
