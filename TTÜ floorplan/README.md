# TTÃœ floorplan
Floorplan images gathered for Tallinn university of technology (#map=17/59.39549/24.66962). Meant to be used in indoor mapping software like OsmInEdit. Photoshop file features floorplans already grouped and linked together.

Warning: OsmInEdit has a bug that after signing in it switches to imagery recommended in specified area, however, editor crashes, if such imagery uses unsupported projection, which is case in estonia.
