### OSM lane tool
The reason, why you are probably here. Simple html-js tool originally meant to make managing multi-lane road tagging easier for users, who primarly use iD and don't wish to switch to Josm. Created in Jan 2021.
### Custom render
Non-OSM TMS-layer rendered from Estonian Land Board's (Maa-amet) public ETAK dataset to try out concept for mapping QA tool. Buildings and roads are rendered there as of Aug 2020. Colour scale of map shows rough estimate, when was last time **geometry** of road or building was last edited. To save bandwidth, layers are only shown until zoom level 14.
